Hello everyone !

Today was a busy day but I still managed to look to some Js code and tutorial and I found on Github : 30 Seconds Of Code.
Interesting website to learn some tips about Js.
I'm still learning Js with MDN and FreeCodeCamp but recently, I rediscovered Grafikart (French Youtuber) who explained Js in simple words with a very detail tutorial he made himself.
Great time to be alive and to learn something we love !

Hope you doing good and living well.
See you soon !
